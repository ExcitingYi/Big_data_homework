Today we answer a question we get from many readers.
Question:
"What are the best ways to study at home?"Ask a Teacher: What are the best ways to study at home?
Answer:
Here are some of the best ideas for healthy study habits: 

Create an area for studying:

Where you study is important. It should be quiet, with good light to read by. You want enough room to spread out your books and notes. A table or desk works well. Be comfortable...but not too comfortable. Do not study on your bed, for example. You might fall asleep!

Cut out the noise:

Some people study better in silence. Others like to have a little noise, like soft music playing. Go with whatever helps you focus.

Cut out the distractions -- and the social media:

Give yourself a break from social media. Put your phone away. And turn off the television. All these things pull you away from what you are trying to learn. Tell the people you live with that you are studying and need time alone to work.

Take breaks:

 Treat yourself after reading something, working through a math problem, or completing some other task you set out to do. Get up, step away from your work and move your body. Go outside for a few minutes and get some fresh air.

Eat so-called "brain foods" that are good for you:

Foods like nuts, seeds, yogurt, berries and fish help your mind stay strong. Sugar may be appealing—especially chocolate, a favorite of this writer -- but too much sugar will give you an energy "crash." And, don't forget to drink plenty of water.
One more thing: when you study, think good thoughts! Avoid bad thoughts like, "I'll never be ready for this test." Instead, tell yourself what you can do: "I can understand and remember this material!"
And Good Luck!
